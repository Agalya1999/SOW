This repository explores the implementation of Deep Learning models for the identification and classification of plant diseases. The aim is to provide farmers with a tool that not only identifies diseases but also offers guidance through videos and immediate remedies to mitigate crop loss.

## 1. Background and Introduction
Historically, farmers have relied on visual inspection to detect crop diseases, often leading to difficult decisions regarding fertilization. This method demands extensive knowledge of various diseases and considerable experience for accurate detection. Compounding the issue, many diseases share visual similarities, causing confusion among farmers. Refer to the image below for a clearer illustration.

## 2. Prevention Strategies
To address these challenges, a robust guidance system is necessary. This system should facilitate accurate disease identification and enable differentiation between visually similar diseases. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer a solution to this problem.

## 3. Convolutional Neural Networks
CNNs, renowned for their effectiveness in image and video recognition, as well as in applications like recommender systems and Natural Language Processing (NLP), are well-suited for this task. Their efficiency stems from parameter reduction, distinguishing them from other deep learning models.
